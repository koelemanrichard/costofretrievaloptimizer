# Semantic SEO Terminology

A comprehensive glossary of key terms used in the Semantic SEO framework.

---

## A

**Algorithmic Authorship**
Writing rules optimized for search engine NLP algorithms, focusing on clear EAV triples, explicit naming, and high information density.

**Anchor Segment**
A word or phrase repeated at the end of one paragraph and the beginning of the next to maintain discourse integration and contextual flow.

**Anchor Text**
The clickable text of a hyperlink. Should be descriptive, varied (max 3x same text per page), and semantically aligned with the target page.

**Annotation Text**
The text surrounding an internal link that provides context and semantic support for the link's relevance.

**Attribute**
A property or characteristic of an entity. In EAV structure, the predicate connecting entity to value. Types: Root, Rare, Unique.

**Author Section (AS)**
The supplementary part of a Topical Map dedicated to building authority through historical data and broader topic coverage. Links primarily to Core Section.

---

## B

**Boilerplate**
Content that appears across multiple pages (headers, footers, sidebars). Receives lower weight from search engines than main content.

**Bridge Topic**
Content that justifies a transition between two contextually distant topics, enabling links across semantic distance.

---

## C

**Canonical Query (CQ)**
The primary query that should trigger a specific page. All semantically close queries should map to pages targeting the CQ.

**Centerpiece Annotation**
The first 400 characters of a page's main content. Critical for initial ranking; must contain core answer/definition.

**Central Entity (CE)**
The single main entity that the entire website is fundamentally about. Must appear consistently site-wide.

**Central Search Intent (CSI)**
The unified action/purpose connecting Central Entity with Source Context. Reflected in core predicates used throughout.

**Context Qualifier**
Words that narrow semantic scope: location, time, demographic, condition (e.g., "for beginners", "in 2024").

**Contextual Bridge**
A dedicated section justifying transition between Macro Context and Micro Context.

**Contextual Coverage**
The completeness measure of how many attributes and angles of an entity are covered in the content network.

**Contextual Flow**
The logical sequence of topics, sections, and sentences within and across pages. Should function as a "straight line."

**Contextual Vector**
The defined heading sequence (H1->H2->H3) that ensures logical, incremental topic flow.

**Core Section (CS)**
The Topical Map segment designed for direct monetization. Receives highest PageRank flow.

**Cost of Retrieval (CoR)**
The computational expense for search engines to crawl, parse, render, and index content. Lower = better.

---

## D

**Discourse Integration**
The smooth connection between sequential sentences and paragraphs through mutual phrases and logical transitions.

**DOM (Document Object Model)**
The tree structure of HTML elements. Smaller DOM = lower parsing cost = lower CoR.

---

## E

**E-A-T (Expertise, Authority, Trust)**
Google quality signals assessing author/site credibility. Critical for YMYL content.

**EAV (Entity-Attribute-Value)**
The fundamental data structure for semantic content. Every fact should be expressible as Subject-Predicate-Object triple.

**Entity**
A distinct, identifiable thing: person, place, product, concept. The subject of EAV triples.

**Entity Reconciliation**
The process of confirming an entity's identity using external references (sameAs property, Wikipedia links).

---

## F

**Featured Snippet (FS)**
The highlighted answer box in search results. Target: <40 words or <340 characters, direct answer.

**Frame Semantics**
The pattern of expected elements triggered by a predicate (e.g., "buy" expects buyer, object, seller, price).

---

## H

**Historical Data**
Accumulated signals from past content performance. Built through consistent publishing in Author Section.

**Hub-Spoke Architecture**
Content structure with central hub pages linking to related spoke pages. Optimal ratio: 1:7.

**Hypernym**
A broader category term (e.g., "vehicle" is hypernym of "car").

**Hyponym**
A more specific term within a category (e.g., "sedan" is hyponym of "car").

---

## I

**Information Density**
Ratio of unique facts to total words. Higher density = more efficient content.

**Information Gain**
New context, attributes, or facts not found on competitor content. Critical for differentiation.

**Initial Ranking (IR)**
The score assigned to a page upon first indexing. Determines starting position.

**Internal Link**
Link between pages on the same domain. Transfers PageRank and signals topical relationships.

---

## K

**Knowledge-Based Trust (KBT)**
Trust score based on consistency and accuracy of EAV triples across the content network.

**Knowledge Graph (KG)**
The networked representation of entities, attributes, and their relationships.

---

## L

**Lexical Hierarchy**
The organization of terms from broad (hypernym) to specific (hyponym).

**Lexical Semantics**
Word-level meaning including synonyms, antonyms, hypernyms, and hyponyms.

**LIFT Model**
Layout framework ordering components by user intent importance (e.g., Buy -> Compare -> Review -> Stats for commercial).

---

## M

**Macro Context**
The primary topic/focus of a page or section. Each page should have one Macro Context.

**Micro Context**
Detailed, supporting content that expands on the Macro Context.

**Micro-Semantics**
Optimization at sentence/word level: word order, predicate selection, modality.

**Modality**
Certainty level expressed by verbs. "Is" = definitive fact; "can" = possibility; "should" = advice.

**Momentum**
Publishing frequency and consistency. Critical for building Historical Data.

---

## N

**Named Entity Recognition (NER)**
The process of identifying and classifying entities in text. Explicit naming aids NER.

**N-gram**
A contiguous sequence of n words. Site-wide N-grams should include Central Entity.

---

## P

**PageRank**
Google's algorithm for measuring page importance based on link structure. Flows through internal links.

**Predicate**
The verb/relationship in an EAV triple. Connects entity to value (e.g., "has", "causes", "contains").

**Predicate Prominence**
The importance of verbs in contextual signaling. CSI predicates should appear in headings/content.

---

## Q

**Query Network**
The collection of related search queries that should be addressed by content in a topic cluster.

**Query Semantics**
The meaning embedded in user search queries, beyond literal keywords.

---

## R

**Ranking Signal Consolidation**
Ensuring clear, non-conflicting signals so search engines know which page ranks for which query.

**Ranking Signal Dilution**
When signals are spread across multiple pages, reducing the effectiveness of each.

**Rare Attribute**
Specific details not commonly found across similar entities. Signals depth of expertise.

**Responsiveness**
How quickly content satisfies user intent. Commercial pages need high responsiveness.

**Root Attribute**
Essential attributes required for entity definition (e.g., population for country).

---

## S

**Semantic Compliance**
Measure of adherence to Semantic SEO framework rules. Target: >85%.

**Semantic Content Network (SCN)**
The interconnected body of content designed for machine comprehension.

**Semantic Distance**
Quantifiable measure of closeness between concepts. Determines clustering and linking decisions.

**Semantic HTML**
HTML tags that communicate meaning (article, section, aside) vs. generic tags (div, span).

**Source Context (SC)**
Who you are and how you monetize. Determines attribute prioritization and topic treatment.

**Source Shadowing**
When a site is suppressed by a "representative source" that Google chose to represent the cluster.

**Subordinate Text**
Text immediately following a heading. Should directly answer/expand on the heading.

---

## T

**Topical Authority**
The accumulated relevance signals that establish a site as authoritative for specific topics.

**Topical Borders**
The boundaries of contextual relevance for a topic. Content beyond borders risks dilution.

**Topical Map (TM)**
The strategic structure of content clusters based on entities, attributes, and relationships.

**Topical Map Distortion (TMD)**
Strategic expansion to dilute competitor authority or increase own coverage.

**Triple**
See EAV. A fact expressed as Entity-Attribute-Value (Subject-Predicate-Object).

---

## U
