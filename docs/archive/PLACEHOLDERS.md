# Placeholder & Incomplete Features Log

This document tracks features that are currently placeholders, incomplete, or known to be buggy. It serves as a focused to-do list for achieving full functionality.

## 1. Core Workflow: Analyze Existing Website

-   **Status:** **NOT IMPLEMENTED IN FRONTEND**
-   **Description:** This entire workflow, designed to be a major feature, is currently inaccessible from the user interface. While the backend Supabase Edge Functions for the analysis pipeline (`start-website-analysis`, `sitemap-discovery`, `crawl-worker`, etc.) exist in the codebase, there is no button or form in the UI to trigger them.
-   **Required Action:**
    1.  Add a UI element to the `MapSelectionScreen.tsx` to start a new "Website Audit" project.
    2.  Implement the necessary handlers in `App.tsx` to call the `start-website-analysis` Edge Function.
    3.  Create a new screen or component to display the status and results of the analysis, polling the `projects` table for status updates.

## 2. Information Gain Service

-   **Status:** **Placeholder**
-   **File:** `services/informationGainService.ts`
-   **Description:** This service is intended to be a core part of the content brief generation and auditing process, calculating a score based on how much novel information a piece of content provides compared to competitors. The file currently contains only placeholder content.
-   **Required Action:** Implement the functions described in the `TECHNICAL_SEO_FRAMEWORK.md`, including `calculateUniqueFactsDensity`, `calculateIncrementalValue`, and `checkAttributeCompleteness`. This will likely involve complex AI prompts and data processing.

## 3. Topical Authority Service

-   **Status:** **Placeholder**
-   **File:** `services/topicalAuthorityService.ts`
-   **Description:** This service is meant to power the "Topical Authority Score" metric on the dashboard. It should perform a holistic analysis of the entire map. The file is currently empty.
-   **Required Action:** Implement a function that takes the full topical map, briefs, and knowledge graph as input and calculates a score based on the criteria in the framework document (content breadth, depth, interlinking, semantic richness).

## 4. Content Calendar

-   **Status:** **UI Placeholder Only**
-   **File:** `components/ContentCalendarModal.tsx`
-   **Description:** The modal for the content calendar exists but shows a "not yet implemented" message. There is currently no backend data model or logic to support scheduling content.
-   **Required Action:**
    1.  Design a database schema to store calendar entries (e.g., a `calendar_entries` table).
    2.  Implement the UI for a calendar view (e.g., using a library or custom grid).
    3.  Implement logic to create, update, and delete calendar entries, likely based on the `PublicationPlan` generated by the AI.
