This list provides a complete, de-duplicated, and action-oriented set of rules for constructing and validating a **Content Brief**, based on the principles of Semantic SEO and Algorithmic Authorship.

The Content Brief serves as the blueprint for content creation, defining the precise execution necessary to optimize the document's relevance and reduce the **Cost of Retrieval** for search engines.

## **I. Foundational Strategy and Entity Alignment Rules (The Core Blueprint)**

These rules anchor the content to the website's identity and determine the prioritization of information based on the **Entity, Attribute, Value (EAV)** model.

| Actie PUNT | REGEL (Rule Detail / Principle) | Goed Voorbeeld (Correct Application) | Fout Voorbeeld (Incorrect Application) | Bronnen |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **A. Central Entity Focus** | The Content Brief must be dedicated to a **single Macro Context** and the **Central Entity (CE)** of the page. | The Macro Context (H1) for a car site focuses exclusively on "Kimber Holsters," not generalizing to all firearm accessories. | Processing two main things on a single page, which causes relevance loss. |  |
| **B. Source Context & Intent** | The content must align with the **Source Context (SC)** (who you are/how you monetize) and the **Central Search Intent (CSI)** (the canonical action). The SC dictates attribute choice and order. | A Visa Consultancy (SC) website structures content to prioritize "Visa Applications" (CSI) over generalized "History" attributes. | Creating content solely for traffic gain without connecting it back to the core monetization goal. |  |
| **C. Section Classification** | Clearly define if the content belongs to the **Core Section (CS)** (monetization focus) or the **Author Section (AS)** (historical data focus). Links must flow from AS back to CS. | The brief for a German Culture article (AS) contains a clear instruction to link back to the "Germany Visa" page (CS). | Linking the high-value Core pages heavily to the Author Section, diluting authority. |  |
| **D. Attribute Prioritization** | Determine the question order in the brief based on the attribute type: **Unique Attributes** first (definitive features), followed by **Root Attributes** (essential definitions), then **Rare Attributes** (specific details). | Prioritize a unique product feature (e.g., VIN number) before common attributes (e.g., price or color). | Prioritizing non-unique attributes, which fails to prove specialized expertise. |  |
| **E. Compliance Threshold** | The brief must be configured for a high level of **Semantic Compliance** (adherence to all rules and patterns) to exceed quality thresholds. The target compliance score is **\>85%**. | The brief specifies the exact content format and structure required to maximize the document's quality score. | Allowing the author freedom to change the headings or word order, which decreases the compliance score. |  |

## **II. Content Structure & Flow Rules (Hierarchy, Layout, and Order)**

These rules ensure the content flows logically, supports efficient passage indexing, and manages the visual presentation of information.

| Actie PUNT | REGEL (Rule Detail / Principle) | Goed Voorbeeld (Correct Application) | Fout Voorbeeld (Incorrect Application) | Bronnen |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **A. Visual Hierarchy** | The structural hierarchy must be reflected visually. Font sizes and weights must signal the rank of the heading (e.g., H1 \> H2 \> H3). | Ensure that H3 typography is visually subordinate to H2 typography. | Breaking the font size/weight structure, confusing the search engine's perception of hierarchy. |  |
| **B. Contextual Vector** | Define the exact, **incrementally ordered Heading List** (H1, H2, H3, etc.) to ensure a straight, logical flow of context. | The sequence of headings logically moves from 'Definition' to 'Symptoms' to 'Treatment'. | Randomly placing H2s without logical progression, which results in a disrupted thought stream. |  |
| **C. H-Tag Usage** | Use H1 to define the page's purpose (Macro Context). Use H2 to define distinct sub-contexts, and H3/H4 to specify the attributes of the parent H2. | Every major contextual shift must begin with a new heading level to communicate segmentation. | Over-segmenting a page by opening a new page for every minor sub-topic instead of integrating it into the current page. |  |
| **D. Content Segmentation** | Define the boundaries between **Main Content** (Macro Context) and **Supplementary Content** (Micro Context). The flow must be gradually transitioned via a **Contextual Bridge**. | Use an H2 (e.g., "Risks and Factors") to smoothly transition between core benefits (macro) and supporting history (micro). | Abruptly changing the topic (e.g., linking from a core topic to an irrelevant one). |  |
| **E. Introductory Summary** | The brief must mandate the creation of a **General Summary** (introduction) that accurately reflects the entire document's content (**Abstractive and Extractive Summary** synthesis). | The author must write the introduction (Abstractive) and then revise it after the full article is written (Extractive). | Writing the introduction without reflecting the full scope of the contextual vector, causing alignment failure. |  |
| **F. Subordinate Text** | The content brief must optimize the **first sentence** after a heading (**Subordinate Text**) for relevance and precision, as it is the **Candidate Answer Passage**. | Mandate that the first sentence be definitive, answering the question directly, especially for Featured Snippet (FS) targets. | Starting the text with subjective or introductory fluff phrases (e.g., "As stated before"). |  |
| **G. Content Format** | Specify the required content format based on the query type (Definitional: prose; Comparison: table/list; Instructional: ordered list) to match the optimal retrieval algorithm. | A 'How-To' query must result in an ordered HTML list where every item begins with an instructional verb. | Using a lengthy descriptive paragraph for a comparative question, resulting in poor **Information Responsiveness**. |  |

## **III. Linguistic & Factual Rules (Precision and EAV Validation)**

These rules are applied at the sentence level to maximize **Information Density** and ensure factual correctness, which contributes to **Knowledge-based Trust (KBT)**.

| Actie PUNT | REGEL (Rule Detail / Principle) | Goed Voorbeeld (Correct Application) | Fout Voorbeeld (Incorrect Application) | Bronnen |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **A. EAV Consistency** | Mandate site-wide **consistency of facts (Values)** and EAV triples. Use units, measurement types, and dates consistently. | All articles referencing a specific pH level use the same numerical range consistently. | Contradicting numerical facts (e.g., population count or molar mass) across different content items. |  |
| **B. Uniqueness & Density** | Mandate **concise sentences** that deliver a unique EAV triple to increase **Information Density**. Avoid repeating information. | Every sentence should answer one clear question. | Writing sentences with unnecessary filler words ("fluff") that dilute context and semantic weight. |  |
| **C. Definitive Answers (FS)** | For answers targeting Featured Snippets (FS), the answer must be **direct, certain, and concise** (typically **\<40 words** or **\<340 characters**). | Use the FS code language in the brief to instruct the author to adhere to the character/word count. | Using non-definitive language (e.g., "around X" or "maybe Y") where a precise answer is required. |  |
| **D. Explicit Naming** | Authors must explicitly state the **Named Entity** or concept to avoid ambiguity and prevent reliance on co-reference resolution. | If discussing a politician, use their full name rather than ambiguous pronouns like "he" or "she". | Using "they" or "it" when the subject's identity could refer to multiple entities in the preceding text. |  |
| **E. Predicate Selection** | Select **functional verbs (predicates)** that align with the **Central Search Intent (CSI)** and the context of the entity. | For a mail merge tool, use predicates like 'subscribe' or 'generate'. | Using vague verbs like 'write' or 'send' when a more specific action is intended. |  |
| **F. Lexical Variation** | Use **synonyms** and **variegated phrases** (Lexical Semantics) for entities and attributes to expand topical coverage without keyword stuffing. | Using hypernyms, hyponyms, and different forms of nouns/adjectives related to the entity. | Repeating the same exact keyword phrase unnecessarily throughout the text. |  |
| **G. No Opinion** | The brief must strictly forbid the insertion of **opinions, subjectivity, or sentiment** in the content; only factual declarations are allowed. | Rely on research papers, statistics, and verifiable sources for statements. | Using phrases like "I feel positive about it" or "In my opinion," which are irrelevant to factual retrieval. |  |
| **H. Discourse Integration** | Ensure sentences and paragraphs maintain **Discourse Integration** by using **mutual words or anchor segments** to ensure a smooth contextual flow. | The end of one paragraph uses a key phrase (anchor segment) that is repeated at the start of the next paragraph/heading. | Abruptly changing topics or failing to connect sequential sentences logically. |  |

## **IV. Visuals, Metadata, and Schema Rules (Non-Text Content)**

These rules ensure that every pixel and byte contributes effectively to the semantic signals and structural relevance of the page.

| Actie PUNT | REGEL (Rule Detail) | Goed Voorbeeld (Correct Application) | Fout Voorbeeld (Incorrect Application) | Source(s) |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **A. Image Selection** | Images must be **unique, licensed, and branded**. For high engagement, use visuals that incorporate data, definitions, or bullet points (**Infographics/Visual Semantics**). | Infographics should be readable and examinable by the search engine. | Using generic stock photos that do not visually reinforce the section's context. |  |
| **B. Image Attributes** | Alt tags and Image URLs must be defined in the brief. They should **expand and variate** the overall topical vocabulary of the page. | Alt tag includes specific contextual attributes (e.g., "Green Tesla Model X Features") rather than just the H1. | Leaving Alt tags empty or having the Alt tag repeat the exact H1. |  |
| **C. Schema Implementation** | Mandate the use of structured data (e.g., Article, Organization, FAQ, Product, AggregateRating) to define the page's attributes and entity identity. | Use Schema to define the author entity and the business's real-world identity (address, social media). | Failing to include necessary EAV data in the structured data, missing a chance to corroborate facts. |  |
| **D. Technical Image Specs** | Mandate the provision of explicit **height and width attributes** for all images to prevent Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS). | Use `srcset` to provide optimized resolution and format (AVIF) where possible. | Injecting images dynamically without defining dimensions, leading to unstable user experience. |  |
| **E. URL Structure** | The URL path should be the shortest possible and must consistently reflect the **Topical Hierarchy** and segmentation (e.g., `domain.com/topic/subtopic`). | Using the short, semantic URL structure `vve-beheer/wet-regelgeving`. | Using overly long URLs or repeating unnecessary words (e.g., `vve-beheer/vve/wet-regelgeving`). |  |

## **V. Internal Linking and Contextual Connections Rules**

These rules manage the flow of authority (PageRank) and relevance between content nodes within the Semantic Content Network.

| Actie PUNT | REGEL (Rule Detail) | Goed Voorbeeld (Correct Application) | Fout Voorbeeld (Incorrect Application) | Source(s) |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **A. Anchor Text Rule** | The brief must specify the exact **Anchor Text** and ensure it is not used more than **three times** per page within the main content. | Varying the anchor phrase (e.g., changing word order or using a synonym) for repeated links. | Using the same anchor phrase excessively, which signals templated content. |  |
| **B. Annotation Text** | The text immediately surrounding the anchor text (**Annotation Text**) must be semantically aligned with the anchor text and the target page's context. | The brief instructs the author to precede the anchor text "Germany Visa" with sentences discussing immigration requirements. | Linking an anchor text in a context that does not semantically support the target page's theme. |  |
| **C. Link Position** | Links must be placed **after the definition** of the entity or concept they refer to. Avoid linking from the first paragraph or the first word of any paragraph. | Link usage should be strategic, prioritizing the most important links in the Main Content zone. | Linking prematurely or embedding links in boilerplate content without contextual justification. |  |
| **D. Link Count** | Control the link budget by using **fewer links per document** to increase the PageRank/relevance weight transferred per link. | Limiting internal links to the most crucial connections within the main content. | Excessive internal linking (e.g., using a large mega-menu or sidebar). |  |
| **E. Jump Links** | Use **URL Fragments (\#jump links)** in conjunction with a Table of Contents (TOC) to link to specific headings/subsections, improving clarity and responsiveness. | The brief mandates a TOC that links to H2s and H3s for easy navigation on long articles. | Forcing the user/crawler to search the entire page for a specific answer within a long article. |  |

## **VI. Essential Concepts Guiding Content Brief Generation**

These are critical strategic and technical concepts that must be understood and considered during the creation and validation of Content Briefs, even if they are not explicitly represented as columns in the brief itself.

| Concept | Explanation and Strategic Importance | Source(s) |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Cost of Retrieval (CoR)** | The primary goal of all rules. Making the content cheaper, faster, and easier for the search engine to crawl, render, and index. |  |
| **Initial Ranking (IR) & Predictive Ranking (PR)** | The brief must generate a page quality high enough to secure a good IR score upon indexing, setting the foundation for long-term PR success. |  |
| **Knowledge-based Trust (KBT)** | The trust score determined by the accuracy and consistency of EAV triples. A high KBT is achieved by demanding factual consistency across all briefs. |  |
| **Uncertain Inference (UI) / Query Semantics** | Understanding that search engines must infer the user's intent, possibilities, and context, often going beyond the literal query terms. The brief must anticipate these inferences. |  |
| **Momentum and Publication Order** | The speed and frequency of publishing high-quality content. The TM must be structured so the **Core Section** is published first to establish trust and generate Historical Data. |  |
| **Contextual Coverage and Weight** | Ensuring the content covers all necessary attributes and contexts. The Content Brief controls the proportional weight given to each attribute on the page to prevent context dilution. |  |
| **Topical Map Distortion (TMD)** | Strategically adjusting the TM (EAVs, attributes, order) to either increase your own authority or weaken a competitor's authority by exposing their content gaps. |  |
| **Semantic Distance and Closeness** | The quantifiable relationship between topics and words. Used to ensure linked concepts are semantically close enough to justify the authority transfer. |  |
| **Discourse Integration** | The seamless flow of context between sequential sentences and paragraphs. The brief uses **anchor segments** (mutual words/phrases) to enforce this flow. |  |
| **LLM Safety and Automation** | Designing the briefs (Algorithmic Authorship Template) so that large language models (LLMs) can generate high-compliance content without hallucinating or introducing factual bias. |  |
| **Content Configuration and Iteration** | The expectation that the content will be continually reviewed and updated based on performance feedback. Briefs must be designed for flexibility and adaptation. |  |
