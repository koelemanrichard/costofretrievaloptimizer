The construction and validation of content within the semantic SEO framework are built upon the **Entity, Attribute, Value (EAV)** model. This structure serves as the foundation for both **Knowledge Base Construction** and **Algorithmic Authorship**, ensuring precise communication with the search engine (the "blind librarian").

The following is a complete and detailed list of rules for determining, constructing, expanding, and validating EAV structures within your Topical Map.

---

## **I. EAV Foundational Definition and Identification Rules**

These rules establish the core components of the EAV structure and define how entities and attributes are identified and prioritized.

| Action Point | Rule Detail / Principle | Good Example (Correct Application) | Wrong Example (Incorrect Application) | Sources |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **A. EAV Structure Definition** | Every fact or content piece must have at least one **Entity**, one **Attribute**, and one **Value** (EAV triple). This structure provides the necessary data for indexing and knowledge base formation. | Entity: 'Berlin'; Attribute: 'Population'; Value: '3.7 Million'. | Providing only an entity and a fact without clear attribute segmentation (e.g., just "Berlin is big and has 3.7M people"). |  |
| **B. Attribute Prominence (Root)** | **Root Attributes** are essential for the entity's definition. If a root attribute is removed, the entity loses its core type or definition. | For the Entity 'Germany', 'Population' is a root attribute; without it, it loses its definition as a country. | For the Entity 'Germany', considering 'Football League' a root attribute; Germany remains a country even without that attribute. |  |
| **C. Unique and Rare Attributes** | **Unique Attributes** (definitive features) and **Rare Attributes** (specific details) must also be identified and prioritized, as they are crucial for proving expertise and differentiating the source. | For a car model, prioritizing its **VIN number** (Unique Attribute) or the **designer's history** (Rare Attribute) for deeper coverage. | Only covering common attributes like 'Max Speed' or 'Color' that are available on every competitor website. |  |
| **D. Attribute Prioritization Order** | When generating questions (content vectors), attributes should be prioritized based on **Uniqueness $\\rightarrow$ Root $\\rightarrow$ Rare**. | The content brief dictates covering the **Unique Attributes** first to establish authority, followed by Root definitions. | Starting the content brief with **Rare Attributes**, which decreases the clarity of the overall context and relevance. |  |
| **E. Content-based Fact Delivery** | Ensure every sentence strives to deliver a concise EAV triple to increase **Information Density**. | Sentence 1: "Berlin is the capital of Germany." Sentence 2: "Its population is 3.7 million residents." (Two distinct EAVs). | Combining multiple facts into one long sentence, making EAV extraction difficult. |  |

## **II. Attribute Selection and Filtration Rules**

These rules govern the methodology for choosing which attributes are relevant to the **Source Context** and the **Query Network**.

| Action Point | REGEL (Rule Detail / Principle) | Goed Voorbeeld (Correct Application) | Fout Voorbeeld (Incorrect Application) | Sources |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **A. Attribute Filtration Criteria** | Attributes must be filtered based on three criteria: **Prominence**, **Relevance (to Source Context)**, and **Popularity (Search Demand)**. | For a visa application website (Source Context), prioritize the 'German language school' attribute over 'German football league' attribute for the entity 'Germany' (Relevance). | Selecting 'German culture' attributes (e.g., literature) without connecting them back to the visa process (Core Section). |  |
| **B. Attribute Connection (Predicate)** | Attributes must be connected to the entity via a relevant **Predicate (verb)**. Predicates define the relationship and contextual frame. | For the core section of a visa application site, predicates should include 'apply', 'immigrate', 'settle down'. | Using vague or low-prominence verbs for the monetization section, like 'look' or 'read'. |  |
| **C. Attribute Types based on Query** | The type of question (definitional, comparative, Boolean, grouping) dictates which attributes must be included and how they are ordered (less I ordered). | A **Boolean question** ("Is X safe?") requires coverage of attributes related to crime rate or security. | Answering a comparative question by focusing only on the definition (Root Attributes) of one entity, ignoring the required comparison attributes. |  |
| **D. Sub-Attribute Classification** | Attributes of an entity must be segmented into **types, components, benefits, risks, or alternatives** to ensure comprehensive topical coverage. | For the entity 'Glasses', attributes are divided into 'types of lenses,' 'frames,' 'brands,' and 'eye health'. | Listing all attributes randomly without classification or using a clear taxonomy (e.g., mixing frame materials with eye diseases). |  |

## **III. Value Constraints and Consistency Rules (Validation)**

The values (facts) assigned to the EAV triples must be strictly validated for accuracy and consistency across the entire content network, which directly relates to **Knowledge-based Trust (KBT)**.

| Action Point | REGEL (Rule Detail / Principle) | Goed Voorbeeld (Correct Application) | Fout Voorbeeld (Incorrect Application) | Sources |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **A. Consistency of Values** | All EAV triples must use **consistent information** for dates, places, ages, and career-related information across the entire website and content network. | If 'Bedroom Trip Frequency' is defined in one article, the definition and associated numeric values must align in all subsequent articles that mention it. | Stating a different mileage (value) for the Honda Civic (entity) in two different articles, creating conflict. |  |
| **B. Precision and Units** | Values must be **precise** and accompanied by their **measurement units** to avoid ambiguity and to satisfy template requirements. | Always provide liters, cups, and gallons when discussing fluid intake to cover all possible query terms. | Stating a value without its unit (e.g., "The length is 10" instead of "10 centimeters"). |  |
| **C. Validation Metadata (Truth Range)** | Use **Validation Metadata** to limit the possible values for attributes, establishing a range of truth (Groundedness). If consensus on a value is unclear, state the possible **"truth range"**. | Instead of stating "The pH is 7.5," state that "The pH level ranges between 7.0 and 7.8, according to various studies". | Giving an absolute, precise numerical value for a fact that is still debatable or has a known variation. |  |
| **D. Perspective-based Values** | For sensitive or complex topics, EAVs should be supported by **multiple perspectives (factors/conditions)** to provide a comprehensive and "Safe Answer". | Stating a fact, then adding perspectives: "Yes, laser cutting produces clean edges, *but* this depends on material (Manufacturer Perspective) and speed (User Experience Perspective)". | Giving only a simple "Yes" or "No" (Boolean logic) without providing the necessary conditions or factors. |  |

## **IV. EAV Application in Content and Network (Template and Expansion)**

EAV principles are the basis for creating structured templates and defining the rules for expanding the **Topical Map**.

| Action Point | REGEL (Rule Detail / Principle) | Goed Voorbeeld (Correct Application) | Fout Voorbeeld (Incorrect Application) | Sources |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **A. Template Consistency** | Use EAV structure to create **Document Templates** for groups of related topics. The template ensures that the attribute collection and contextual flow remain similar across the set of documents. | Creating one template for 'Car Repair' where attributes like 'cost' and 'time' are always in the same place and format across all car models. | Using a completely different content structure for entities of the same type (e.g., using a list for 'Ford' but a table for 'BMW'). |  |
| **B. Contextual Consolidation** | EAV models define the **Contextual Consolidation** and depth of the document based on the chosen entity-attribute pairs. | The core entity 'Glasses' is connected to sub-contexts like 'eye health' and 'lenses'. | Allowing a highly focused micro-contextual detail to dominate the page, causing dilution of the macro context. |  |
| **C. Topical Map Expansion** | Expansion is achieved by covering **more entities from the same type**, **more attributes of existing entities**, or **deepening the context with further consistency**. | Expanding 'Glasses' (entity) by covering more diseases (attributes) that affect the eyes, or covering 'Contact Lenses' (entity of the same type). | Expanding into an unrelated domain (e.g., a site about car holsters suddenly writing about unrelated military equipment). |  |
| **D. Traversal Retrieval** | Connect EAV models of different entities using **mutual attributes** to enable information retrieval across different knowledge domains. | Connecting 'Car EAV' and 'Plane EAV' via the mutual attribute 'Motor' (engine). | Creating a link between 'Car' and 'Plane' without establishing a clear, justified mutual attribute or context. |  |
| **E. Interlinking based on EAV** | Internal links and their anchor text should be determined by **entities, attributes, types, stages, or phases**. | Using the anchor text "types of glasses" to link to the page that lists all attribute types. | Linking two pages that share no mutual context or attribute connection. |  |

## **V. Essential EAV Related Concepts (Not Categorized Above)**

These important concepts are deeply tied to the EAV methodology and are crucial for understanding the **Topical Map** construction.

| Concept | Explanation and Strategic Validation | Correct and Wrong Examples | Sources |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Semantic Dependency Tree** | The analysis of the grammatical structure of a sentence (who does what to whom) to establish relationships between entities and attributes. Simple, short sentences are preferred to maintain a clear dependency tree. | **GOED:** Writing sentences where the Agent, Patient, and Predicate are clearly defined (a low dependency depth). **FOUT:** Using overly long, complex sentences that confuse the relationships between entities. |  |
| **Semantic Role Labeling (SRL)** | The labeling of words based on their semantic function (Agent, Theme, Cause) related to the **Predicate** (verb). SRL ensures that the subject in the query matches the subject in the document. | **VALIDATION:** Ensures that if the query asks for the 'Agent' of an action, the document's SRL structure provides the correct 'Agent' entity. |  |
| **Frame Semantics / FrameNet** | A knowledge organization system that patterns situations based on **Verbs** (predicates). It ensures that the required 'tools' and related entities (Attributes) of a situation are included. | **VALIDATION:** If the verb is "Cook," FrameNet predicts the relevance of attributes like 'potatoes,' 'aubergine,' and 'time/duration'. |  |
| **Topical Map Distortion (TMD)** | Strategically modifying the EAV structure, attribute weighting, or contextual boundaries in the TM to dilute a competitor's authority or decrease the accuracy of their facts. | **Actie:** Publishing content on **micro-queries** or rare attributes that competitors have not covered, pulling traffic away and causing the competitor to dilute their ranking signals if they try to imitate. | **FOUT:** Distorting your *own* TM by opening web pages for every micro-query, which fragments PageRank and relevance. |
| **Content Configuration** | The process of changing the **word order, connections, and placement of sentences/sections** to increase relevance and responsiveness, based on EAV and query feedback. | **Actie:** Changing the order of questions (H2s) in 30 different content briefs based on search engine feedback to see if the new order improves Featured Snippet performance. | Writing content once and leaving it static, missing the opportunity to adjust prominence by configuring EAV placement. |
| **Contextual Variables** | Dimensions of context (e.g., location, time, user intent) that modify the output of the Information Retrieval system. EAV values must be validated against these variables. | **Actie:** Using the location (e.g., 'London') as a **Context Qualifier** in the query and verifying that the EAV triples (e.g., prices) reflect the correct local value. | Failing to address a context qualifier (e.g., ignoring 'London' in the query and giving only global pricing information). |
