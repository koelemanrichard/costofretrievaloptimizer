This list provides a comprehensive and action-oriented breakdown of the essential columns (data dimensions) required to construct and process a meaningful Topical Map (TM), based on the principles of the semantic SEO framework. The goal of defining these columns is to create a structured system for generating high-compliance content briefs and decreasing the **Cost of Retrieval** for search engines.  
A Topical Map consists of major contexts, and multiple topics or entities can reside on a single page, while the same topic can be represented across multiple pages.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Required Columns for Topical Map Construction  
The columns are categorized based on their function within the content engineering and strategic planning process.  
I. Foundational Components and Node Identification  
These columns define the core entity and context for each content node (topic cluster or document) within the network.

| Column Category | Required Data Point (Column) | Description and Content Requirement | Source(s) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Node Identity** | **Central Entity (CE)** | The primary entity (e.g., Germany, Water, QR Code) of the entire topical map. Must appear site-wide and be consistent. |  |
| **Node Identity** | **Topical Map Section** | Defines the node's function: **Core Section (CS)** (for monetization and Central Entity \+ Source Context unification) or **Author Section (AS)** (for gathering historical data, sessions, and relevance). |  |
| **Node Identity** | **Attribute (or Subtopic)** | The specific attribute or characteristic of the Central Entity being covered (e.g., 'Religion,' 'Climate,' 'Population,' 'Visa Types'). |  |
| **Node Identity** | **Target Query Network** | The specific primary query or cluster of related queries (Query Network) that the node is designed to satisfy. |  |
| **Node Identity** | **Canonical Query (CQ)** | The single, most representative query for the entire query cluster/network targeted by the content piece. |  |
| **Node Identity** | **Query Type** | Categorization of the query (e.g., Definitional, Comparative, Grouping, Boolean, Instructional) to guide the required answer format. |  |

II. Content Structure and Hierarchy (The Content Brief Blueprint)  
These columns serve as the direct blueprint for the content brief, defining the internal flow and micro-level structure of the document.

| Column Category | Required Data Point (Column) | Description and Content Requirement | Source(s) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Contextual Flow** | **Macro Context / H1** | The verbalized entity-attribute pair, which defines the **single main focus** and topicality of the page. This is usually reflected in the Title Tag. |  |
| **Contextual Flow** | **Contextual Vector (Headings)** | The incrementally ordered list of headings (H2, H3, etc.) that ensures a straight, logical flow of context within the document. |  |
| **Contextual Flow** | **Contextual Hierarchy** | The structural level of each heading (H1, H2, H3, H4), signaling the relationship between concepts. |  |
| **Contextual Structure** | **Article Methodology / Format** | Specific instructions for the author regarding content formatting: prose, list definition/listing (with item count), tables, or specific sentence structures. Must use the correct format in the correct spot. |  |
| **Contextual Structure** | **Subordinate Text Hint** | Instructions or a summary for the content that immediately follows a heading. Crucial for **Predictive Information Retrieval** and optimizing the **Candidate Answer Passage**. |  |
| **Contextual Structure** | **Image Alt Text / URL Hint** | Instructions for the image's Alt Tag and URL. Should expand the overall topicality vocabulary and use relevant phrases/synonyms (usually max 3 words for URL). |  |
| **Contextual Structure** | **Perspective Requirement** | Specifies which perspectives (e.g., developer, user, scientist, linguist) or specific entities (e.g., competitor names, experts) must be included to enrich context and coverage. |  |
| **Contextual Structure** | **EAV Consistency Check** | Notes to ensure that the factual values (dates, numbers, measurements, names) used for the EAV triples are consistent with all other content briefs. |  |

III. Interlinking and Contextual Connections  
These columns define the essential internal linking strategy for each node, ensuring proper **PageRank flow** and **contextual transfer** throughout the Semantic Content Network.

| Column Category | Required Data Point (Column) | Description and Content Requirement | Source(s) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Connection (Target)** | **Target URL / TM Node** | The destination URL or node within the TM that the anchor text will link to (e.g., the Core Section or a relevant attribute/entity). |  |
| **Connection (Signal)** | **Anchor Text** | The descriptive phrase used for the internal link. Must be semantically relevant and aligned with the target page's H1/title. |  |
| **Connection (Signal)** | **Annotation Text Hint** | Instructions for the text surrounding the anchor text. Should be optimized to further signal the relevance between the source and destination page. |  |
| **Connection (Flow)** | **Contextual Bridge Link** | Specifies the link that connects the Macro Context (Main Content) to the Micro Context (Supplementary Content), or links the Author Section back to the Core Section. |  |
| **Connection (Check)** | **Anchor Repetition Count** | Tracks how many times a specific anchor text has been used in the document (must not exceed three per page). |  |

IV. Logistics, Metrics, and Strategic Management  
These columns monitor the execution, quality, and performance of the TM strategy.

| Column Category | Required Data Point (Column) | Description and Content Requirement | Source(s) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Logistics** | **Publication Date (Momentum)** | The planned date for publishing. The sequence and speed of publication are critical for establishing **Momentum** and Historical Data. |  |
| **Metrics** | **Semantic Compliance Score** | The required quality score measuring the content's adherence to the brief and algorithmic authorship rules (Target: **\>85%**). |  |
| **Metrics** | **Hub-Spoke Ratio** | The metric for checking the structural efficiency of the node's position within its cluster (Optimal: **1:7**). |  |
| **Metrics** | **Context Coherence Score** | A metric to ensure the document's sections flow logically and are not discordant (Target: **\>0.8**). |  |
| **Validation** | **Initial Ranking (IR) / Status** | Tracks the initial ranking performance of the page upon indexation, which reflects the page's structural quality and E-A-T. |  |
| **Validation** | **Topical Borders/TMD Note** | Notes defining where the topic ends and where a neighboring topic begins. Used for planning **Topical Map Distortion (TMD)** or expansion strategies. |  |

VI. Essential TM Concepts Not Covered in Column Structure  
While the column structure covers the operational requirements, several fundamental concepts are essential for the TM's success and must be considered during its construction, validation, and expansion phases.

| Concept | Explanation and Strategic Importance | Source(s) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Source Context (SC)** | Defines the purpose and identity of the website (who you are and how you monetize). The SC dictates the configuration of the entire TM, attribute prioritization, and contextual flow. |  |
| **Topical Map Distortion (TMD)** | Strategically modifying the EAV structure or attribute weighting to weaken the topical authority of a competitor by diluting their facts or coverage. |  |
| **Topical Borders** | The lines that define where a topic starts and where it ends. Setting clear borders is necessary to prevent content dilution and maintain focus. |  |
| **Index Construction Rule** | A new page (segment/node) should only be created if the query network requires a **separate index construction** due to distinct entity, high search demand, or low semantic similarity. Otherwise, the information should be integrated into an existing document. |  |
| **Semantic Distance (SD)** | The calculated distance between two concepts or topics, often measured by 1 \- (Cosine Similarity × Context Weight × Co-occurrence). SD defines the relationship between nodes and shapes the contextual path. |  |
| **Topological Refinement** | The continuous process of checking **Query Refinement Candidates** (midstring queries) to update the TM and ensure the network covers all relevant semantic compounds. |  |
| **Knowledge-based Trust (KBT)** | The trust score based on the accuracy, uniqueness, and consistency of the EAV data provided by the source. TM design must maximize KBT. |  |
| **Lexical Semantics** | The study of word meanings, including synonyms, antonyms, hypernyms (class/set), and hyponyms (instance). Essential for defining entities and connecting content. |  |
| **Site-wide N-grams** | Consistent phrases or words used across the entire website (e.g., in boilerplate or menus) that communicate the site's primary focus and topicality to the search engine. |  |
