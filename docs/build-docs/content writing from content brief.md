This guide provides a comprehensive set of rules for writers executing a **Semantic Content Brief** based on Koray Tuğberk GÜBÜR’s framework. The goal is to maximize **Information Density**, ensure **Contextual Consistency**, and minimize the **Cost of Retrieval (CoR)** for search engines.

This document is divided into **Pre-Writing Analysis**, **Algorithmic Authorship Rules**, **Structural Requirements**, and **Linking Strategies**.

### **I. Phase 1: Analyzing the Content Brief (Pre-Writing)**

Before writing a single word, the writer must decode the logic of the brief. A semantic brief is not just a list of headings; it is a calculated **Contextual Vector**.

| Element | Action Required | Why? (The Logic) |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Contextual Vector** | Read the headings from H1 to the last Hx in order. Do not rearrange them. | The headings form a "straight line" of meaning. Changing the order breaks the **Discourse Integration** and confuses the search engine about the main topic. |
| **Source Context** | Identify *who* is speaking (e.g., "Visa Consultancy" vs. "Travel Blog"). | The tone and selected attributes must match the brand's identity. A visa consultant focuses on *laws/requirements*; a travel blog focuses on *fun/experience*. |
| **Central Entity (CE)** | Identify the main subject (e.g., "German Shepherd"). | The CE must be the grammatical subject of most sentences in the Main Content. |
| **Attribute Prioritization** | Look for **Root, Rare, and Unique** attributes in the brief. | **Root:** Must be covered (e.g., Dog \> 4 legs). **Unique:** Differentiates the entity (e.g., German Shepherd \> Police work). **Rare:** Increases topical authority (e.g., German Shepherd \> specific genetic disease). |

### **II. Phase 2: Macro-Context Rules (The Introduction)**

The introduction (Macro Context) determines how the search engine categorizes the rest of the document. It must be handled with extreme precision.

#### **1\. The Centerpiece Annotation Rule**

* **Rule:** The absolute definition and the direct answer to the user's main intent must appear within the **first 400 characters**.  
* **Action:** Do not use "hooks," stories, or rhetorical questions. Start immediately with "X is Y."  
* **Wrong:** "Have you ever wondered what a German Shepherd is? In this article, we will explore..." (Fluff/Delay).  
* **Correct:** "The German Shepherd is a medium-to-large-sized working dog breed that originated in Germany." (Direct Definition).

#### **2\. The Abstractive & Extractive Summary Rule**

* **Rule:** The introduction must summarize the *entire* article. If you take the first sentence of every H2 in the article, they should align perfectly with the summary provided in the intro.  
* **Action:** Mention the sub-topics (attributes) that will be discussed later in the introduction.  
* **Example:** "This guide covers German Shepherd **diet**, **training requirements**, **grooming needs**, and **common health issues**."

### **III. Phase 3: Algorithmic Authorship (Sentence Construction)**

This is the core of **Micro-Semantics**. Writers must stop writing like "bloggers" and start writing like "encyclopedists" to satisfy the Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms.

#### **A. Information Density & Fluff Removal**

* **Rule:** Every sentence must contain a Fact (Entity \+ Attribute \+ Value). If a sentence does not add new information, delete it.  
* **Stop Words:** Remove words that add no semantic value: "basically," "actually," "very," "really," "in fact," "just."  
* **The "Also" Rule:** Avoid the word "also." It usually signals a weak connection or a lazy transition. Use a specific transition instead.  
  * *Wrong:* "It is also good for digestion."  
  * *Correct:* "Fiber improves digestion by regulating bowel movements."

#### **B. Modality (Certainty vs. Possibility)**

* **Rule:** Match the verb's modality to the factual certainty.  
* **Fact:** Use "is/are." (e.g., "Water **is** vital.")  
* **Possibility:** Use "can/may." (e.g., "Excessive water **can** cause hyponatremia.")  
* **Advice:** Use "should." (e.g., "Patients **should** consult a doctor.")  
* **Wrong:** "Water might be important for health." (Vague).  
* **Correct:** "Water is essential for metabolic function." (Definitive).

#### **C. Sentence Structure (S-P-O)**

* **Rule:** Use **Subject-Predicate-Object** structure. The Main Entity should be the Subject.  
* **Wrong:** "To lose weight, drinking water is helpful." (Passive/Object-focused).  
* **Correct:** "Drinking water aids weight loss by increasing satiety." (Active/Entity-focused).

#### **D. Discourse Integration (Flow)**

* **Rule:** The object of the previous sentence should become the subject (or context) of the next sentence. This creates a "chain" of meaning.  
* **Example:** "Engines require **fuel**. **Fuel** combustion generates energy. **Energy** propels the pistons."

### **IV. Phase 4: Formatting & Information Extraction**

Search engines use visual structure to extract facts (Information Extraction). The formatting must correspond to the type of information.

#### **1\. Lists (Ordered vs. Unordered)**

* **Rule:** Use **Ordered Lists (`<ol>`)** for rankings, steps, or hierarchies (e.g., "Top 10," "How to").  
* **Rule:** Use **Unordered Lists (`<ul>`)** for items of equal value (e.g., "Ingredients," "Features").  
* **The List Definition Rule:** Never drop a list without a preceding sentence defining exactly what the list contains.  
  * *Correct:* "The primary symptoms of dehydration include:" \[List follows\].

#### **2\. Tables**

* **Rule:** Use tables for **comparative attributes** (e.g., Price, Speed, Weight) of multiple entities.  
* **Action:** Ensure the first column is the Entity Name and subsequent columns are Attributes.

#### **3\. Bold Text (Emphasis)**

* **Rule:** Bold the **Answer Term**, not the question. Bold the **Value**, not the Entity.  
* **Wrong:** "**What is the speed?** The car goes 100mph."  
* **Correct:** "The car reaches a top speed of **100mph**."

### **V. Phase 5: Contextual Connections (Internal Linking)**

Internal links pass PageRank and define the relationship between topics.

#### **1\. Link Placement**

* **Main Content (Macro Context):** Links to highly relevant, core topics should be placed in the body paragraphs.  
* **Supplementary Content (Micro Context):** Links to loosely related topics (side topics, definitions of terms) should be placed at the bottom or in the "Micro Context" section (after the main H2s).  
* **Delaying the Link:** Do not link in the first sentence of a paragraph. Define the concept first, *then* link.

#### **2\. Anchor Text & Annotation Text**

* **Rule:** The anchor text must be descriptive (e.g., "German Shepherd Diet," not "Click Here").  
* **Annotation Text Rule:** The words *surrounding* the link must describe what the user will find on the target page.  
  * *Correct:* "For detailed nutrition plans, review our guide on **German Shepherd Diet**."

### **VI. Phase 6: What to Avoid (The "Do Not" List)**

Writers must strictly avoid these patterns to prevent **Contextual Dilution**.

| Violation | Description | Consequence |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Contextual Shifting** | Changing the subject mid-article (e.g., starting with "Car Engines" and drifting into "Car Insurance"). | Confuses the search engine about the page's primary topic. |
| **Repeating Information** | Answering the same H2 question twice or repeating the definition in sub-headings. | Increases CoR (Cost of Retrieval) without adding value (Information Gain). |
| **Opinionated Language** | Using "I think," "In my opinion," or "Beautiful/Amazing." | Reduces **Knowledge-Based Trust (KBT)**. Search engines want facts, not opinions (unless it's a specific review entity). |
| **Broken Hierarchy** | Using an H3 that is broader than its parent H2. | Destroys the semantic structure of the page. |
| **Orphaned Content** | Writing a section that has no logical bridge to the previous section. | Breaks the "Contextual Vector." Use transitional sentences (bridges). |

### **VII. Final Checklist for the Writer**

1. Did I define the main entity in the first 400 characters?  
2. Is every sentence a fact (Entity \+ Attribute \+ Value)?  
3. Did I remove all "fluff" words (also, very, basically)?  
4. Do the headings follow the exact order of the brief?  
5. Are lists properly defined before they appear?  
6. Are links placed after the concept is explained, not before?  
7. Does the tone match the Source Context (e.g., formal for medical, instructional for DIY)?

By following these rules, the writer ensures the content is **Machine-Readable**, **High-Authority**, and **Semantically Consistent**.
