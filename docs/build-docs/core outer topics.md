The distinction between the **Core Section** and the **Author Section (Outer Section)** of the Topical Map is the most fundamental aspect of your **Semantic Content Network (SCN)** architecture. This segregation is necessary to maximize **Topical Authority** and efficiently manage the flow of **PageRank** and **historical data**.

This analysis provides a complete and detailed breakdown of both sections, their roles, rules, and technical implementation.

## **I. Definitions and Purpose of Core vs. Author Sections**

The two sections serve distinct strategic purposes related to monetization and authority building.

| Component | Primair Doel (Primary Purpose) | Semantische Definitie (Semantic Definition) | Bronnen |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Core Section** | **Monetization** and **Conversion**. | The unification of the **Central Entity (CE)** and the **Source Context (SC)**. It is where all PageRank and internal links are intended to flow. |  |
| **Author Section** (Outer/Supplemental) | Gaining **Historical Data** (user sessions, clicks, queries) and **Topical Relevance**. | The unification of the **Central Entity (CE)** with a specific part of the **Central Search Intent (CSI)** (often the "know" predicate). |  |

---

## **II. Topical Map Structure and Contextual Coverage**

The structure of these sections determines the **Contextual Vector** and the overall expertise signaled to the search engine.

### **A. Coverage and Depth Rules (Vastness, Depth, Momentum)**

| Actie PUNT (Action Item) | Core Section Rules | Author Section Rules (Outer) | Bronnen |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **1\. Depth Focus** | Must go **deep** and be highly **detailed**. Focus on granular attributes of the Central Entity (CE) relevant to monetization (e.g., visa types, product specifications). | Generally stays **flat**. Only covers a topic broadly to establish vastness, momentum, and historical data, without going deep into every attribute. |  |
| **2\. Contextual Linkage** | Directly addresses the query network related to the **Source Context** (e.g., product purchasing, service application). | Must be connected **back to the Core Section** as much as possible. If a topic cannot connect back, it should not be opened as a dedicated page. |  |
| **3\. Content Format** | Often utilizes formats that maximize **Information Extraction Responsiveness** (e.g., structured lists, tables, direct definitional answers). | Often relies on **prose content** to provide general background or historical data. |  |
| **4\. Root Attribute Priority** | Contains the most important attributes that are directly connected to the monetization goal. | Focuses on attributes that are less crucial for monetization but necessary for overall topical coverage (e.g., history, culture, politics). |  |
| **5\. Canonical Query** | The Core Section should rank for the **Canonical Query** (the most central search intent). | The Author Section helps the Core Section rank higher by ranking for adjacent, long-tail, or historical queries, and then passing authority. |  |

### **B. Placement within the Page Structure**

The placement of content from these sections reflects its **Contextual Weight** and priority.

| Actie PUNT (Action Item) | Macro Context (Main Content \- Above the Fold) | Micro Context (Supplementary Content \- Below the Fold) | Bronnen |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Core Content** | Always prioritized in the **Macro Context** (the main content section) to signal the main topic and gain immediate ranking signals. | Links from the supplementary content should point back to the Core Section, but the core content itself dominates the macro context. |  |
| **Author Content** | Should not disrupt the Macro Context of the Core Section. May be used strategically near the beginning if it forms a direct "bridge" (e.g., definitions). | Primarily resides in the **Supplementary Content** section. It provides related, but not core, information to the reader. |  |

---

## **III. Internal Linking and PageRank Flow**

The primary linkage strategy involves transferring authority from the high-volume traffic pages (Author) to the high-monetization pages (Core).

| Actie PUNT (Action Item) | REGEL (Rule Detail / Principle) | Goed Voorbeeld (Correct Application) | Fout Voorbeeld (Wrong Application) | Bronnen |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **A. Flow Direction** | PageRank and ranking signals must flow **from the Author Section into the Core Section**. | Pages covering 'German culture' (Author) link to pages covering 'German work visa' (Core). | Linking Core pages extensively to general Author pages, diluting the Core PageRank. |  |
| **B. Position of Link** | Internal links transferring authority should be placed lower on the page, in the **Micro Context** (bottom part of the article), to increase the link weight. | The link to the core mail merge page is placed at the bottom of the birthday mail article. | Placing the internal link to the Core Section within the first paragraph of the Author section. |  |
| **C. Anchor Text** | Anchor text must be descriptive, reflecting the context of the destination page, and should include the entity or attribute. | Anchor text: "German Visa Requirements," linking to the visa section. | Using "Read More" or "Click Here," which dilutes contextual value. |  |
| **D. Link Prioritization** | Internal links in the **Main Content** are far more valuable than those in the boilerplate (header/footer). | Prioritize contextual links within the article body, reserving header/footer for critical site-wide and E-A-T links. |  |  |

---

## **IV. Technical and Maintenance Requirements**

Technical compliance ensures the search engine can efficiently process the distinct function of each segment, lowering the **Cost of Retrieval (CoR)**.

| Actie PUNT (Action Item) | REGEL (Rule Detail / Principle) | Context / Specification | Bronnen |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **A. URL Structure** | **Core Section:** Often uses a **flatter** URL structure (closer to the root entity). **Author Section:** Often uses a **deeper** (more hierarchical) URL structure. | The URL structure should be predictable and hierarchical to help the search engine understand the site tree. |  |
| **B. Query Connection** | Every node (page) in the Topical Map must be connected to a specific **query and a user**. If a concept lacks search demand, it must be integrated into an existing page. | Do not open a new page (node) just for topic coverage; it must be query-driven. |  |
| **C. Quality Nodes** | The **Core Section** contains the highest-quality, most authoritative articles (**Quality Nodes**). These must be linked directly from the homepage/header area. | This encourages the search engine to go deeper into the SCN after seeing quality content early. |  |
| **D. Structured Data** | Structured Data (Schema Markup) must explicitly define the Central Entity and the page function. Core pages may use `Product` or `Service` Schema; Author pages use `Article` or `AboutPage` Schema. | All Schema must corroborate the facts presented, supporting the overall **KBT (Knowledge-based Trust)**. |  |
| **E. Content Templates** | Use Content Brief Templates configured specifically for the Core and Author sections. Templates must be revised continuously, as context shifts. | A Core template might prioritize tables and direct answers, while an Author template focuses on historical data and definitions. |  |

## **V. Expansion Strategy and What to Avoid**

### **A. How to Expand the Topical Map (Core vs. Author)**

The expansion process must maintain alignment with the **Source Context** to prevent dilution of the primary focus.

| Section | Expansion Strategy | Actionable Detail | Bronnen |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Core Section Expansion** | **Deepening the Context:** Cover more attributes of existing entities and explore sub-attributes related to monetization. | Expand the coverage of **product specifications**, usage guidelines, shipping policies, and product alternatives. |  |
| **Author Section Expansion** | **Vastness and Momentum:** Cover more entities from the same type, and deepen the historical or contextual angles. | Use **Contextual Bridges** to connect the Core subject to adjacent contexts (e.g., connecting electric cars to general car history or overall battery types). |  |

### **B. What to Avoid (Fout Voorbeeld / Wrong Application)**

| Actie PUNT (Action Item) | Violation Principle | Consequence | Bronnen |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **1\. Primary Focus Dilution** | Processing the Author Section too deeply, making it seem like the website's main topic. | The search engine may see the website's **Primary Focus** (Source Context) as something other than the intended Core Section, leading to demotion. |  |
| **2\. Irrelevant Links** | Linking content without a clear contextual bridge or connection to the Core Entity. | Signals irrelevant topics, making the search engine see that you are "chasing traffic" without reason. |  |
| **3\. Breaking Consistency** | Using conflicting definitions or facts between Core and Author sections. | Reduces **Knowledge-based Trust (KBT)** and harms credibility. |  |
| **4\. Redundant Pages** | Creating separate pages for concepts that do not deserve a unique index construction (e.g., low search demand topics). | Wastes **Crawl Budget** and decreases PageRank per document. |  |
| **5\. Static Boilerplate** | Using fixed header and footer links that do not change based on the content segment. | Dilutes PageRank to irrelevant sections and reduces the prominence of links in the Main Content. |  |
